# Instagram-API-python

I don't use my instagram too much any more. But I like to have fun with my bio. This code updates my bio every minute with the current time (and a little message).

### Edit:
While this does work with AWS Lambda, I've taken it out of commission. It was *technically* against the Instagram TOS, and I would rather have my account with a lame bio than not have my account with an even lamer one.
